# Write a program that:
# 
# Asks the user to enter a list of words 
# separated by spaces. The program should 
# only print the words that have an even 
# number of characters
#
# Example (`mountain pink vines` is the input):
#
#   "Enter a list of words separated by spaces:"
#   mountain pink vines
#   "mountain"
#   "pink" 
#
# (Hint: remember you can nest conditionals inside
# of loops)

p "Enter a list of words separated by spaces:"


# ~~~~~ Specs (make it do these things) ~~~~~
#
# even_word.rb prints the 'mountain' and 'pink' when the input is 'mountain pink vines' 
# 
# even_word.rb prints nothing when the input is 'odd numbers squad'
#
